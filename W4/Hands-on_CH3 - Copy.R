# Hands-on Week - Working with **gapminder** Data
# Please be advised that this file should be run without any modification on any RStudio software. Therefore, it is essential to include all necessary libraries and prerequisit syntaxes. 

# a) What happens when you put the *geom_smooth()* function before *geom_point()* instead of after it in *Healy_CH3.R*? What does this tell you about how the plot is drawn? Think about how this might be useful when drawing plots. 
# =========================================== Part a =======================






# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ End of Part a +++++++++++++

# b) Change the mappings in the *aes()* function so that you plot **life expectancy** against **population (pop)** rather than per capita GDP. Also, refine all functions/labels accordingly. What does that look like? What does it tell you about the unit of observation in the dataset?
# =========================================== Part b =======================




# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ End of Part b +++++++++++++

# c) Try some alternative scale mappings. Besides *scale_x_log 10()*, you can try *scale_x_sqrt()* for population (pop)
# =========================================== Part c =======================




# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ End of Part c +++++++++++++

# d) What happens if you map *color* to year instead of *continent*? 
# =========================================== Part d =======================




# +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ End of Part d +++++++++++++

# * e) Instead of mapping *color = year* in part d, what happens if you try *color = factor(year)*?
# =========================================== Part e =======================
